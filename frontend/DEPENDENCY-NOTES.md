# Dependency Notes

Where possible, dependencies are frequently updated to their latest versions.
In some cases, however, this is not feasible or does not provide sufficient
return on the necessary investment to do a major version upgrade. The following
dependencies are currently fixed to older versions:

- **react-redux**, **redux**, and **redux-thunk**: The latest Redux stack requires React 18.
- **axios**: Axios is currently tracking the latest version, but it requires the `transformIgnorePatterns` in the Jest configuration in `package.json`. This should be monitored to see if Axios, Jest, or react-scripts update to support this natively. If so, the full `"jest"` property in `package.json` can be removed safely.
- **tocbot**: Tocbot is currently fixed to `v4.17.3` (or other patch versions) in order to avoid multiple errors logged to the console. In this version, and all previous versions, there is only one error logged when navigating away from the Documentation page.
  These errors increased after version `v4.17.3`.
  [This commit](https://github.com/tscanlin/tocbot/commit/be66ad95284ebd21299a203d5479e12d85e34d62) may be related to new errors.
  Eventually, it will be good upgrade this package, but it may require reaching out for input on Github.
- **eslint**: ESLint v9 was released recently. However, eslint-config-airbnb still requires ESLint v8. Based on [this issue](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/2961), they are working on updating to support v9. Hopefully, it will be supported soon, and when it is, we can update to the latest ESLint.

## Notes about overrides

- **nth-check**: nth-check is updated to the latest major version in the overrides list because `react-scripts` has dependencies that require a version with a vulnerability.
  If/When react-scripts updates to address the vulnerability, this override can be safely removed.
